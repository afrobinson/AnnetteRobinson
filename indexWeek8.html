    <!--I have built on Week 7 and coded Week 8 into the body. See lines 87-138.
      Week 8 is repurposing my own educational content from Week 7:
        -adds an array of the eight QM CPE standards with a "for" loop that writes out this abbreviated version to a bulleted list
          It is not perfect as it writes immediately to the page; but it works.
        -adds a second "for" loop with a prompt asking the user to rate each standard, then writes the user input to an ordered list
          that displays on the page (the ol is styled in the CSS)
        -improves the visual design over Week 7 by adding columns:
            Week 8 content is primarily in the left div "column-1"
            I have re-styled the class assignment flex container into the right div "column-2"-->

          Not sure how orthodox it is, but it seems tidier in this case to have each output paragraph paired with the JS that writes to it.
          Also because I chose this way to fix some positioning trouble where the JS could not see the output paragraph that came after it-->
