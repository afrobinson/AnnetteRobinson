    <!--This is EME 6930 Week 9 Loop Assignment
        It repurposes the educational content from Week 5
        It keeps the Week 5 functions that write information on local schools to an output paragraph below school buttons,
        but increases the number of schools from 3 to 5.
        It adapts "Pedogogical_array_exampleB" from Week 8 (keeping or adapting most of the relevant comments); repurposes my Week 5 form 
        to ask how many schools the parent wants to put their child on a waiting list for; asks them to enter those school names after 
        reviewing information on each school; asks if they want to add an additional school of their choice to the list; then provides 
        a button to output the final list of schools whose waiting list they want their child to be on-->
